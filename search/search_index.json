To ensure accurate rendering on the web and/or PDF, kindly refrain from using file paths that begin with a slash when linking any media. Any <code>.md</code> file that is not named <code>index.md</code> will be mapped to a file named <code>index.md</code> placed in a folder with the original <code>.md</code> file. For example, a file called <code>game.md</code> in the docs folder will become <code>/game/index.md</code> once deployed.
